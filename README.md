# Project: Rock Paper Scissors

## Overview

## Demonstrated Skills

- **JavaScript Functions**: Implemented core game logic using functions for player input, computer choice, and round results.
- **Conditionals**: Utilized conditional statements to determine the outcome of each round and track scores.
- **Loops**: Applied loops to run the game for a set number of rounds or until a player wins.
- **User Interaction**: Integrated prompt-based user input and console-based feedback.
- **HTML Integration**: Linked JavaScript to an HTML file to create a basic web interface.
